The year {{ lastYear }} ended yesterday. It is the perfect time to recap what has been done during this year in {{ city }}:
- the city accommodates {{ newInhabitants }} new inhabitants ;
- {{ newCompanies }} were created by fellow citizens ;

Our mayor extended his greetings this morning from the city hall in front of dozens of citizens. He said that: "The year {{ year }} promises to be a year of many challenges and opportunities. And our city is ready to seize them successfully.".
